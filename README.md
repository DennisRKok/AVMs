## About the Author
I'm Dennis Kok, student Master Operations Management & Logistics at the TU/e. This repository contains the models made for my thesis 'Designing an explainable and accurate comparable sales method for residential real estate.'. 

## About the scripts
This repository consists of two python files. The first file contains the novel Forest Based Comparable Sales Method. 
This model was designed to be both explainable and accurate in prediction residential real estate prices. 
The second file contains the Quantitative Comparative Approach. 
This model was proposed by I-Cheng Yeh and Tzu-Kuang Hsu in their paper 'Building real estate valuation models with comparative approach through case-based reasoning' (2018). 
It was rebuild in python for the purpose of studying the predictive power in relation to my own novel model.
